Spamhaus/JANET feed reporter
============================

This is a basic perl script to extract HELO information from mail
server logs and send it to the JANET slurper, ready to push over
to Spamhaus. It's intended as a stopgap solution for Exim until
Tony Finch's udpsend patch is readily available in distributions,
but could be used for other mail servers.

It tails the mailserver log file to look for specific patterns
that contain the required information. This means that the
mailserver has to be configured to output that pattern. An
example for exim is given below.

The pattern is:

<random data>SHF:sender_ip<tab>HELO string<tab>timestamp<tab>RDNS\n

It's expected that <random data> is the log timestamp. Exim can
generate this format in its mainlog with the following; it should
be added at the top of the HELO ACL, before any connections have
been rejected:

--8<-----
acl_helo:

  warn
#   hosts    = ! +relay_hosts
    logwrite = SHF:$sender_host_address\t$sender_helo_name\t$tod_epoch\t$sender_host_name
--8<-----

The "hosts" line is optional - it is a good idea to remove local
IP addresses here to save them going into the log, but otherwise
the script will strip them out.


Having configured the mail logs and checked that SHF: lines are
appearing, the daemon can be installed and configured.
spamhausfeed should be copied to /usr/local/sbin, and the few
variables at the top should be adjusted for your own situation.
The JANET reporter hostname and port should be set.

 - set the location of the exim mainlog*

 - adjust the pidfile if necessary (also in the init script)

 - add regular expressions to match your local networks, as these
   should not be reported

 - add regular expressions to match your local domains that should
   not be seen in HELO strings from remote mailers

 - set JANET reporter hostname and port

* if you use exim logfiles in the form mainlog-YYYYMMDD (which I
highly recommend) then you should have a cronjob that points a
symlink to the latest logfile each night; then point this script
at the symlink. An example script that does this is:

--8<-----
#! /bin/sh
# new extension of file is hostname-YYYYMMDD
NE=`hostname -s`-`date +%Y%m%d`
ln -fs /srv/log/exim/main-$NE /srv/log/exim/mainlog
ln -fs /srv/log/exim/reject-$NE /srv/log/exim/rejectlog
--8<-----

Finally, install the init script as /etc/init.d/spamhausfeed, or
wherever your system requires it, and run, for example:

  insserv -vd spamhausfeed

to get the daemon started at boot. Then fire it up.

To check that things are running you can use tcpdump:

  tcpdump -nvi eth0 -- host report.dnsbl.ja.net

or edit the script to send to localhost, then use netcat to
listen:

  nc -lup 1387

When all is sending fine, notify JANET to get your feed checked
and added to the Spamhaus data.
